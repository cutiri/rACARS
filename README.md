# ACARS

ACARS stands for "Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System". It's a digital data link system used to transmit messages between airplanes and ground stations via airband radio or satellite.

In terms of VirtualFlight.Online, phpVMS ACARS is a software application you can run alongside Microsoft Flight Simulator that helps you track flights, refer to operational flight plans, and review your performance while in flight.

# rACARS

rACARS is a middleware application designed to bridge the gap between flight simulation software and the PHP VMS 7 API. It acts as an intermediary to track each step of your flight in simulations such as MSFS, X-Plane, or Prepar3D, and report these details to the API of your Virtual Airline. This enables your Virtual Airline to collect and manage flight data effectively, allowing for real-time tracking and future reference of simulated flights.

## Features

- **Support for Multiple Simulators**: Works with Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS), X-Plane, and Prepar3D.
- **Integration with PHP VMS 7**: Seamlessly reports flight data to the PHP VMS 7 API.
- **Real-Time Flight Tracking**: Captures and reports detailed flight information in real-time.
- **Flight Data Recording**: Keeps a record of each flight for future reference and analysis.
- **Friendly User Interface**: It shows in real time your airplane in a world map as well as the flight parameters.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **.NET Framework**: Ensure that the .NET Framework 4.8 or later is installed on your system.
2. **Flight Simulation Software**: MSFS, X-Plane, or Prepar3D must be installed and properly configured.
3. **PHP VMS 7 API**: Access to a PHP VMS 7 installation with API access enabled. You will need a PHP VMS 7 API Key that will be provided to you by your Virtual Airline.

### Steps

1. **Download rACARS**: WIP.

2. **Install rACARS**:
   - Extract the downloaded ZIP file and extract. Software doesn't need installation.

3. **Configuration**:
